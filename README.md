## Features:

- Precision Movement: Utilizes the HSR-1425CR motor for smooth, controlled rotation that ensures accurate ointment application.
- Range of Motion: The device’s applicator moves left and right with a 360° rotation for thorough and comfortable coverage.
- EMG-Controlled Mechanism: Integrated with an Arduino, the motor is exclusively triggered by EMG signals, responding to muscle contractions for seamless user operation.
- Lightweight Design: Weighing 347g, the device is comfortable to wear, reducing strain on the residual limb and preventing irritation.
- Gentle Pressure Application: The motor applies moderate, controlled pressure suitable for burn-affected areas and creams of different viscosities.

## Engineering Components:

- Arduino & EMG Integration: Ensures precise control over motor activation.
- Torque and Pressure: Delivers 0.27–0.33 Nm for gentle application.
- Circuit Design: Includes an instrumentation amplifier, voltage buffer, bandpass filter, full-wave rectifier, peak detector, and voltage regulator for stable and efficient operation.
